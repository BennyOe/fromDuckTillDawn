# Sound System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the game's sound system. It is a robust, **event-driven** system designed for flexibility and easy management of all audio aspects, from entity-specific sounds to environmental audio.

The core principle is that game systems (like the `AnimationSystem`) do not play sounds directly. Instead, they fire **events** to request a sound, and a central `AudioSystem` handles the logic of selecting and playing the correct audio file.

-----

## Step 1: Configuration (`SpawnCfg.kt`)

The foundation of any entity's sound capabilities is laid out in its spawn configuration. This is where we define *what* sounds an entity can make and *when* it makes them.

1.  **`SoundProfile`**: Each entity is assigned a `SoundProfile`. This profile acts as a map, linking logical `SoundType` enums (e.g., `DAWN_FOOTSTEPS`, `HIT`) to specific `SoundAssets` audio files (e.g., `DAWN_FOOTSTEPS_WOOD.mp3`). The profile distinguishes between simple sounds and context-dependent ones, such as footstep sounds that change based on the surface (`FloorType`).

2.  **`soundTrigger`**: This map defines the exact moment a sound should be triggered within an animation. It links an `AnimationType` and a specific frame index to a `SoundType`. For example, the player's walking animation is configured to trigger a footstep sound on frames 3 and 6.

**Example from `main/kotlin/io/bennyoe/config/SpawnCfg.kt`:**

```kotlin
// ... for "playerStart" entity
SpawnCfg(
    // ...
    soundTrigger =
        mapOf(
            AnimationType.WALK to
                mapOf(
                    3 to SoundType.DAWN_FOOTSTEPS, // On frame 3...
                    6 to SoundType.DAWN_FOOTSTEPS, // ...and 6, trigger a footstep.
                ),
        ),
    soundProfile =
        SoundProfile(
            // ...
            // Maps floor types to specific footstep sound files
            footstepsSounds =
                mapOf(
                    FloorType.WOOD to SoundAssets.DAWN_FOOTSTEPS_WOOD,
                    FloorType.STONE to SoundAssets.DAWN_FOOTSTEPS_STONE,
                ),
        ),
)
```

## Step 2: Triggering (`AnimationSystem.kt`)

As the game runs, the `AnimationSystem` is responsible for updating all entity animations frame by frame.

1.  When the system detects a frame change in an animation, it checks if a `soundTrigger` exists for that new frame in the entity's configuration.
2.  If a trigger is found, the `AnimationSystem` fires a `PlaySoundEvent`. This event is a data package containing all necessary information: the entity that made the sound, the logical `SoundType`, volume, the current `FloorType`, andâ€”crucially for 3D audioâ€”the precise world position where the sound originates.

**Example from `main/kotlin/io/bennyoe/systems/AnimationSystem.kt`:**

```kotlin
// ... calculate objectCenter position ...

stage.fire(
    PlaySoundEvent(
        entity,
        soundType = soundType,
        volume = 1f,
        position = if (soundType.positional) objectCenter else null, // Position for 3D audio
        floorType = pCmp.floorType, // Current ground surface type
    ),
)
```

-----

## Step 3: Central Hub (`AudioSystem.kt`)

The `AudioSystem` is the heart of the sound logic. It constantly "listens" for any audio-related events fired within the game.

1.  **Event Handling**: The system is registered as an `EventListener` and handles events like `PlaySoundEvent`, `PlayLoopingSoundEvent`, and `StopLoopingSoundEvent`.
2.  **Listener Position**: In its `onTick` method, the `AudioSystem` continually updates the position of the audio **listener** (which is always the player). It uses the player's position from the *previous* frame (`playerPhysicCmp.prevPos`) to ensure perfect synchronization with the sound event, which was triggered *before* the current frame's physics update. This prevents audio panning issues.

-----

## Step 4: Mapping (`SoundMappingService.kt`)

Once the `AudioSystem` receives a `PlaySoundEvent`, it needs to determine which specific audio file to play. It delegates this task to the `SoundMappingService`.

1.  This service takes the logical `SoundType` (e.g., `DAWN_FOOTSTEPS`), the entity's `SoundProfile`, and the `FloorType` as input.
2.  It looks up the correct `SoundAssets` file in the provided `SoundProfile`. If the `SoundType` is surface-dependent (`isSurfaceDependent = true`), it uses the `footstepsSounds` map; otherwise, it uses the `simpleSounds` map.

**Example from `main/kotlin/io/bennyoe/service/SoundMappingService.kt`:**

```kotlin
fun getSoundAsset(
    type: SoundType,
    profile: SoundProfile?,
    floorType: FloorType? = null,
): SoundAssets? {
    // ...
    return if (type.isSurfaceDependent) {
        // Look in the footstepsSounds map
        profile.footstepsSounds[floorType] ?: profile.footstepsSounds.values.first()
    } else {
        // Look in the simpleSounds map
        profile.simpleSounds[type]
    }
}
```

-----

## Step 5: Playback (with TuningFork)

With the correct audio file identified, the `AudioSystem` handles the final playback using the **TuningFork** library.

1.  **Get Sound Buffer**: It retrieves the pre-loaded `SoundBuffer` from the `AssetStorage`.
2.  **Obtain Source**: It gets a `BufferedSoundSource` from the audio engine.
3.  **Set Properties**: It configures the source with all properties from the event: volume, 3D position (if positional), looping status, pitch variation, etc.
4.  **Play**: It calls `source.play()` to play the sound, which is now audible in the game at the correct position and time.
